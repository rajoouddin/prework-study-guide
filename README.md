# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework.  It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript.  This project was to help learn the basics and make notes of key things learnt for each topic.

This guide can be used by others to help them if they need it.  In creating this guide it has helped me to understand the flow of creating/editing, saving and uploading to a repo.

To use this Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section.  For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing `Command+Option+I` (MacOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux).  A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser.  There you will see a list of topics we learned from Prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
